This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`].

Hi, I'm Ann Mary. I did this project as a part of an assignment. 
This is a NextJS project. I used custom CSS and Tailwind CSS for styles. I have tried my best to make it responsive on every device.

## Briefing on the Dependencies I used:
* @next/font: for local font (could also be used for google fonts, but i find CSS imports of them to be much simpler)
* axios: for fetching data from API
* react-icons: for the icons inserted
* tailwind-scrollbar-hide: as the name suggests. Really helpful though!


## Challenges faced
* 1 challenge i faced was while running 'npm run build' or 'npx next build', it displayed "build error with EISDIR (Build failed because of webpack errors",
apparently this happens because your project folder is not in C drive.
* Also the supposed url of pictures through the doesn't provide images everytime, some result in "Pending Payment". So i used other url from the response.
